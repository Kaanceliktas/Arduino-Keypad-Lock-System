When we supply the system with power, first of all we can see the programmed writings on the LCD screen then we need to enter the password thanks to keypad. By the way we used relay module to set up a password and have the Arduino activate a relay then while we are entering the password we have symbols to hide them, after that on the one hand if the password is correct as you can see on the video, we will have a response like access granted and our green light will shine but on the other hand if the password is wrong then the our response will be Access denied and our red light will shine. Before ending, in addition we used breadboard to connect LCD and lights to the Arduino. After all to collect them properly we made a model and also you can see on the video, like this way this is the our first prototype.
